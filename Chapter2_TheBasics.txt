Chapter 2 The basics


1.Alan Turing "On computable numbers,with an application to the Entscheidengsproblem"

2.Turing machine, finite state machine

3.an algorithm is a procedure

4.The machine - no access to any form of concurrent execution;
				standard, basic operations all take constant amounts of time;
				one computer word is not unlimited but is big enough to address all the memory locations used to represent our problem, plus an extra percentage for our variables.

5.a problem is a relation between input and output.

6.Python list is implemented as a single,contiguous slab of memory

7.Asymptotic notation 's core idea is to represent the resource we're analyzing as a function of the input size.

8. big oh(g) is the set of functions that are faster than g
   omega(g) is the set of functions that are slower than g
   theta(g) is the set of functions that have the same asymptotic growth with g.

9. an algorithm with polynomial running time is considered feasible while an exponential one is useless.   

10. theta rules
